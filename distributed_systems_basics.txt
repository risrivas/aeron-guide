# Message Passing
##################

https://aeroncookbook.com/distributed-systems-basics/message-passing/

- distributed systems are built either using:
synchronous rpc
asynchronous message passing

- advantages of async mp:
1. loosely coupled
2. resiliency - primary component failure can be serviced by secondary, transparent to sender
3. simpler to implement
4. consume less resources

- Agrona and Aeron enable developers to build reactive systems built with message passing
- Agrona's RingBuffer is the basic: https://aeroncookbook.com/agrona/concurrent/#ring-buffers
- uses large scale multicast
- approach to writing the business logic remains consistent â€” react to an inbound message and produce zero or more outbound messages

# Replicated State Machines
############################

https://aeroncookbook.com/distributed-systems-basics/replicated-state-machines/

- for building fault-tolerant services with distributed systems
- different than state machine design pattern

- features:
1. encodes its states internally
2. accepts commands that address a single method
3. deterministic methods process each command
4. commands mutate state and/or produce events
5. Snapshots - rsm internal state to be captured at a moment of time
6. Set - rsm internal state to be set to a given value

commands -> single deterministic methods -> produce events

- many rsm, when follow above rules will process commands in order and produce same events and same internal state
- how to get different rsm agree on order of commands from concurrent client requests and failures => Consensus Algorithms
- using the snapshot and set, we can us it for recovery - save the snapshot at any stage and set it back to that snapshot whenever needed in future

- in Simple State Machine code,rsm state is defined by the order of commands
- this helps to have a fully deterministic ordering of input events
- Aeron Cluster define its own commands and events, along with code to build a snapshot and restore from a snapshot
- Aeron and Aeron Archive provide total ordering capablities within a single channel and stream
