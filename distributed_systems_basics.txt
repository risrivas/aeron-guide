# Message Passing
##################

https://aeroncookbook.com/distributed-systems-basics/message-passing/

- distributed systems built either:
synchronous rpc
asynchronous message passing

- advantages of async mp:
1. loosely coupled
2. resiliency - primary component failure can be serviced by secondary, transparent to sender
3. simpler to implement
4. consume less resources

- Agrona and Aeron enable developers to build reactive systems built with message passing
- Agrona's RingBuffer is the basic: https://aeroncookbook.com/agrona/concurrent/#ring-buffers
- uses large scale multicast
- approach to writing the business logic remains consistent â€” react to an inbound message and produce zero or more outbound messages

# Replicated State Machines

- for building fault-tolerant services with distributed systems
- different than state machine design pattern
